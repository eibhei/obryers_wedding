        The wedding celebration is in Sawley Village Hall, North Yorkshire. Why Sawley? It’s a stone’s throw away from Bee’s old stomping grounds, and we liked it!

        Yes! More detail will be included with the invitations, but there is parking. However, we would encourage guests where possible to share a lift with a friend, both to save space, and the planet.

   Can I bring my children?

      <p>
        Yes, absolutely! Children are both welcome and encouraged. We are parents ourselves, and don’t want anyone to feel they need to find a babysitter to be able to join us. We’re planning a kid-friendly event, so please bring them along. That said, if you want to find a babysitter and have an afternoon to yourselves, that’s fine too!

        At this stage (pre-invitations), we don’t have the exact running order of the day finalised. However, it is important to know that this not an all-day event. Our rough plan is to start in the early afternoon, and kick you all out at about 9pm. If you want to stay past kickout time, you will be assumed to be helping us tidy up.

        If you would like to give us a gift, thank you! It’s really kind of you. We don’t have a registry for physical gifts, but if you would like to contribute to our honeymoon pot, we'll make a link available to do so closer to the time of the event. There is no obligation, and we are incredibly grateful to anyone who chooses to do so.

        It’s important to us to keep our wedding ceremony an intimate occasion. From our perspective, we don’t want the ceremony itself to be a Big Event. We want it to be a significant, personal milestone. Also, we picked out a rock we want to stand on and there just isn’t enough room on it for everyone.

   Will you feed me?

      <p>
        Yes! There will be nibbles earlier on in the day, and a buffet style meal in the evening. If you have any dietary requirements and/or allergies, please let us know. As mentioned before, we are planning a kid-friendly event and are very experienced with fussy eaters, so "dietary requirements" extends to, “my child only eats mild cheddar cheese and ketchup.”

        Not in the village hall, no. However, Sawley is not far from Ripon, where there are hotels, AirBnBs, and regular BnBs available. There are also various AirBnBs in the surrounding villages, and, if you’re feeling adventurous, the nearby village of Kirkby Malzeard has a campsite.
