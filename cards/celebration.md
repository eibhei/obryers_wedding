Finally, the bit you actually care about! On May 30th, we will be having a wedding celebration in a North Yorkshire village hall. It’s important to us to be pretty clear that this _isn’t_ a wedding reception as you might expect - it’s a party, with some of the bits of wedding receptions thrown in.
\
For example, there will not be: a cocktail hour, a formal wedding breakfast, a first dance, or a disco that goes until midnight.
\
But there will be: a wedding cake, food, drinks, two brides, a guest book (of sorts), and some speeches.
\
We are really looking forward to celebrating with all of you, so hope you can make it. For more details about the day, please visit: [The FAQ]({% link faq.md %})
