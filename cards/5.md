Have you pulled The Invitation card from the deck yet?  
\
No?  
\
Then you can’t access The RSVP.[^1] Try again later.

[^1]: To the overseas contingent of the family: if you intend to come, please pop us a message to let us know now! You will still receive an official invitation, but knowing how many of you can attend will help our planning.
