We’ll level with you here - you’re probably not invited to this bit. We started planning a wedding with all the trappings and trimmings of what you’d expect from a big day, and quickly realised that it simply wasn’t for us. So what is for us, you ask?
\
Eloping! On May 23rd 2026, rain or shine, we will be outdoors in Scotland tying the knot, with only our children, parents, and witnesses.

Why Scotland? Well for one thing, it’s gorgeous. For another, we wanted to get married outdoors, and being able to pick any location we liked felt incredibly freeing.
\
So, the summary: you won’t be there for our vows. However, we still want to celebrate with our loved ones, which leads nicely onto the event you _are_ invited to: [The Celebration.]({% link 3.md %})
